<h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
members and administrators pledge to making participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.</p>
<h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
address, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Community administrators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Community administrators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the community. Examples of representing the
community include using an official community e-mail address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative
at an online or offline event. Representation of the community may be further
defined and clarified by community administrators.</p>
<h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the <a href="https://wwucs.slack.com/account/team">administrators</a>. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The administrators are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.</p>
<p>Community administrators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the community's leadership.</p>
